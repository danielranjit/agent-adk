**Logline:** In the 16th century, driven by a desire for accuracy in the Age of Exploration, cartographer Gerardus Mercator battles religious persecution and scientific limitations to create a revolutionary world map that transforms navigation.

**Act I:**
*   Introduce Gerardus Mercator, a brilliant but struggling scholar and instrument maker in Flanders. He is deeply religious but questions the accepted Ptolemaic view of the world, sensing it doesn't align with the new discoveries being made by explorers.
*   Mercator faces skepticism from the Church and academic authorities who are resistant to new ideas. He is accused of heresy for his unorthodox views and briefly imprisoned.
*   A wealthy merchant, impressed by Mercator's skill and vision, commissions him to create a new world map that can aid in navigation, promising resources and protection.

**Act II:**
*   Mercator dedicates himself to the map, facing immense challenges in gathering accurate data. He corresponds with sailors and explorers, but their accounts are often conflicting and unreliable. He struggles with the mathematical problem of representing the spherical Earth on a flat surface.
*   He develops his revolutionary Mercator projection, but faces resistance from those who believe it distorts the sizes of landmasses. A rival cartographer, jealous of Mercator's talent and commission, attempts to discredit his work and steal his data.
*   Mercator is forced to defend his work before a panel of scholars and navigators, demonstrating the practical benefits of his projection for seafaring, despite its distortions.

**Act III:**
*   Mercator completes his world map, which is initially met with controversy and criticism. However, its accuracy in representing rhumb lines (lines of constant bearing) makes it invaluable for navigation, and it gradually gains acceptance among sailors and explorers.
*   Despite his success, Mercator faces ongoing challenges. He must constantly defend his work against accusations of heresy and deal with the political implications of his map, as different nations use it to assert their claims to newly discovered territories.
*   The film concludes with Mercator, now an old man, reflecting on the impact of his map on the world. He sees how it has helped to open up new trade routes, connect distant lands, and change humanity's understanding of the planet, leaving a lasting legacy.
