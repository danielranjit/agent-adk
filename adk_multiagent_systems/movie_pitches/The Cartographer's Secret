Logline: An Ottoman admiral and cartographer races against time and rival empires to complete a revolutionary world map, piecing together lost knowledge and daring voyages, before his ambition and controversial methods lead to his downfall.

Act I:

Introduce Piri Reis, a young, ambitious Ottoman admiral and cartographer, fascinated by maps and exploration. He possesses a burning desire to create the most accurate world map ever seen.
Piri's uncle, Kemal Reis, a famous corsair, mentors him in the ways of the sea and the importance of knowledge. They engage in naval battles and daring raids, gathering geographical information and encountering diverse cultures.
Kemal Reis dies, and Piri dedicates himself to creating his world map. He gathers fragments of ancient maps, including a potentially lost map of Columbus, and interviews sailors and explorers to gather information. He faces skepticism and ridicule from the Ottoman court, who see his passion as a distraction from more pressing matters.

Act II:

Piri Reis painstakingly compiles his map, incorporating diverse sources and challenging existing geographical assumptions. He travels to different ports, seeking out rare charts and collaborating with scholars, facing resistance from those who guard their knowledge jealously.
The Ottoman Sultan, Selim I, recognizes the potential value of Piri's map and provides him with resources and support. Piri presents the completed map to the Sultan, gaining fame and recognition.
As Piri's reputation grows, he attracts the attention of rival European powers, particularly the Portuguese, who seek to steal his knowledge and disrupt Ottoman dominance in the Indian Ocean spice trade. He faces espionage and betrayal from within the Ottoman court, where some see him as a threat to their power.
Piri is appointed admiral of the Ottoman fleet in the Indian Ocean, tasked with pushing back against the Portuguese and securing Ottoman trade routes. He achieves initial military successes, expanding Ottoman influence.

Act III:

Piri's ambition and controversial methods, including prioritizing plunder and potentially disobeying orders in pursuit of riches, lead to conflicts with his superiors. Driven by the promise of wealth, he launches a siege of Hormuz, a Portuguese-controlled island and key stronghold in the spice trade.
The siege of Hormuz fails. Piri, more interested in looting Qeshm Island after the wealthy residents of Hormuz evacuate there, abandons the siege, further angering his superiors.
Accused of corruption and insubordination for his failure at Hormuz and his prioritizing of plunder, Piri is summoned back to Cairo to face trial. Despite his past achievements and the potential value of his map, he is found guilty and sentenced to death.
In his final moments, Piri reflects on his life and legacy, accepting his fate but knowing that his map holds valuable knowledge that will eventually inspire future generations. Centuries later, a historian stumbles upon the fragmented map in the Topkapi Palace, recognizing its significance and sparking renewed interest in Piri Reis's life and work. The film ends with a shot of the rediscovered map, its details hinting at the vast knowledge Piri Reis possessed and the enduring legacy he left behind.
