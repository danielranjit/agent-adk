Logline: Driven by a vision of unity, King Alexander I of Yugoslavia establishes a dictatorship to forge a single national identity, only to be assassinated amidst rising ethnic tensions, leaving behind a legacy of both unification and fragmentation.

Act I: Seeds of Unity and Discord
- Introduce Alexander, his early life, and his ambition to unite the fractured Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes after WWI. Show his dedication to modernization and infrastructure projects.
- Highlight the deep-seated ethnic and religious tensions between Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. Introduce key political figures like Stjepan Radić, who champions Croatian autonomy.
- Alexander attempts to bridge the divides through diplomacy and a new constitution (Vidovdan Constitution), but faces increasing political gridlock and rising nationalism. Radić’s assassination by Puniša Račić creates a crisis.

Act II: The Iron Hand of Unity
- Driven by the assassination of Radić and the ensuing chaos, Alexander, believing it necessary to save Yugoslavia, establishes a royal dictatorship (the 6 January Dictatorship) with the stated goal of creating a unified Yugoslav identity.
- Explore Alexander’s internal conflict: his belief in unity versus the suppression of individual ethnic identities. Show the pressure from different factions and his increasing paranoia.
- The dictatorship intensifies ethnic tensions. Croats and other groups feel marginalized as Serbian dominance grows. The suppression of dissent leads to underground resistance movements. Economic hardship during the Great Depression further fuels discontent.
 - Include individual stories impacted by Alexander's policies to increase emotional investment: a silenced intellectual (professor), an imprisoned activist (student), and a persecuted family (economic hardship and ethnic discrimination).

Act III: Legacy of Division
- Facing growing internal opposition and external threats (Hungarian revanchism, Italian fascism), Alexander seeks international support and forms alliances like the Balkan Pact.
- He embarks on a state visit to France to secure support but is assassinated in Marseille by Vlado Chernozemski, a member of IMRO, highlighting the festering ethnic hatred and the failure of his unification project. French Foreign Minister Louis Barthou is also killed.
- The assassination throws Yugoslavia into further turmoil. His young son, Peter II, inherits a deeply divided nation. The film concludes by showing the seeds of future conflict sown by Alexander’s actions, foreshadowing the eventual bloody breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, yet acknowledging his initial noble, albeit misguided, vision of unity. Show newsreel footage of the Balkan Wars to underscore the legacy of division.
