Logline: A brilliant but unorthodox Isaac Newton battles religious dogma and scientific rivals to unlock the secrets of the universe, revolutionizing science and mathematics forever.

Synopsis:
- Introduction of Isaac Newton as a young, inquisitive, and somewhat rebellious student at Cambridge. He is fascinated by mathematics and natural philosophy but feels stifled by the traditional Aristotelian teachings.
- Newton begins his own independent studies, delving into the works of Galileo, Kepler, and others. He starts developing his own theories on motion, optics, and calculus.
- The Great Plague forces Newton to retreat to his family home in Woolsthorpe. During this time of isolation, he makes groundbreaking discoveries, including the laws of motion, universal gravitation, and the foundation of calculus.
- Newton returns to Cambridge as a Lucasian Professor of Mathematics. He faces resistance and skepticism from the established scientific community regarding his new theories.
- Newton develops the reflecting telescope, providing further evidence for his theories on light and optics. He publishes *Opticks*, solidifying his reputation as a leading scientist.
- A bitter rivalry develops between Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz over the invention of calculus. The controversy escalates into a major intellectual battle, dividing the scientific world.
- Newton publishes *Principia Mathematica*, a monumental work that establishes the laws of motion and universal gravitation. The book is initially met with controversy but gradually gains acceptance as its predictions are confirmed.
- Newton is appointed Warden of the Mint and later Master of the Mint, playing a key role in reforming the British currency. He continues his scientific pursuits, making further contributions to mathematics, physics, and astronomy.
- The film concludes with Newton receiving widespread recognition for his scientific achievements, solidifying his place as one of the greatest scientists of all time. However, the film also hints at the personal sacrifices and internal conflicts that accompanied his genius.
